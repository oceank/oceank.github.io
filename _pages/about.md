I am a third-year PhD student in the department of <a href="https://cse.sc.edu">Computing Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.sc.edu">University of South Carolina</a>. My research interests include *reinforcement learning*, *transfer learning*, *deep learning* and *adversarial example*. Currently, I am working with Prof. Jamshidi to enable a robot to automatically adapt itself to the environment by applying machine learning to optimally configure the robot based on a given budget.

Before joining the PhD program, I obtained a M.S. degree in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University in 2014, and then worked as a software engineer for Intel Security (2014-2016) and Synopsys (2016-2017). During my study at Michigan Tech, I worked with Prof. Havens on the fuzzy clustering of social networks.
