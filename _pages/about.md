I am a PhD student in the department of <a href="https://cse.sc.edu">Computing Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.sc.edu">University of South Carolina</a> and working under the supervision of <a href="https://qizhg.github.io">Prof. Qi Zhang</a> in the <a href="https://aiisc.ai">AI Institute</a>. My research interest is to utilize the power of language to enhance the capability of reinforcemnet-learning agents. 


Previously, I did some work on self-adaptive system, multi-objective optimization and detection of adversarial examples with <a href="https://pooyanjamshidi.github.io">Prof. Pooyan Jamshidi</a> and <a href="https://cse.sc.edu/~zeng1">Prof. Qiang Zeng</a> at University of South Carolina. Before joining the PhD program, I obtained a M.S. degree in Computer Science from Michigan Technological University in 2014, and then worked as a software engineer for Intel Security and (later) Synopsys. During my study at Michigan Tech, I worked with <a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~thavens/">Prof. Timothy Havens</a> on the fuzzy clustering of social networks.
